### Ethics
What are the ethical 'guidelines' for using the Blockchain? Are they individualistic or collectivist?
The fact that forks have to be collectively adopted points to the latter. But of course individuals can use the blockchain unethically. So we need both!

### Legal
What is the blockchain and it's community, in legal terms? What are limits to the law due to jursidictional questions?
What is the power and role of regulation in Blockchain technology (if any).

### Politics/Corporate Governance
What is the optimal for blockchain governance? What is the role of community consensus? Soft forks or hard forks?
What is the tradeoff between having explicit rules and processes versus ad-hoc processes? How can we visualize the latter?
What is the scope of the governance problem? Only tech upgrades? Or maybe also intervention with consensus (e.g. the DAO).
What is the cost of governance? What are the tradeoffs between high and low cost governance?
How can governance process be secured from manipulation? How can a governance process guarantee the representation of clients + 3rd parties?

### Social
What is the role of the blockchain in society? Reducing transaction costs? Providing trusted services? Circumventing systems of control?

### Cultural
How do you coordinate decisions across different cultures/languages? How do you ensure blockchains are not dominated by one country?
